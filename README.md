Back in 2010 I was playing with javascript while traveling in TTC to ODS2 office located in Downtown.

This is a pure JS app, no libs used. I think all objects are instances and methods are shared via prototypes.

Plans:
- Tony just gave me an idea for a next version: show part of a hidden picture when a block gets landed.
- Also I was planning to rebuild the game using RxJS to see how well it works.
